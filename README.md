### **Database Design Projects**
In all the **Database Design Projects**, I have included the main **`.sql`** file, the **`.dbml`** schema file, an **`.svg`** of the schema diagram and revelant **`.png`** image for the schema. Ihave written all the `SQL` code in `SQLite3`. It can however be modified to meet the needs of all other SQL databases.
